Just imagine, that you can write E2E tests using familiar javascript syntax without any external dependencies, like
node.js, jest, Axios, etc. Sounds like something impossible? ðŸ˜‰
</div>

> ðŸš§ The project currently is under active development. Do not use it somewhere except the testing purposes.

## ðŸ”¥ Features list

- Write your tests in ECMAScript 5.1 (`let`, `const`, arrow functions and classes are supported)
  syntax ([JS VM](https://github.com/dop251/goja) embedded in the app)
- Tests are parallelized by running them in their own thread to maximize performance
- Ready to work out of the box, config free
- Cross-platform (like any go-based app)
- The jest-like syntax for grouping tests cases and asserts
- Built-in **faker** (fake data generator, like strings, numbers, IP addresses, UUIDs, and so on), **hashing** and **encoding** functions
- Easy to use by developers and QA engineers

## âš™ Usage

Let's start from the simplest example. Create a file `./test.js` with the following content:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env poke run

describe('test API', () => {
  test('data posting', () => {
    const resp = post('https://httpbin.org/post', {
      body: JSON.stringify({string: faker.string()})
    })

    console.log(resp)

    assert.equals(resp.status, 200)
  })
})
```

And run it:

![shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7326800/203788784-80b791f9-03c3-4c8a-a9fc-c8b267f16d65.gif)

Wildcards (`?*`) and double stars (`**`) are allowed. For example, you can run all tests from the `./tests` (including all nested) directory:

```shell
./poke run ./tests/**/*.js
```

## ðŸ§© Installation (WIP)

Download the latest binary file for your arch (to run on macOS use the `linux/arm64` platform) from
the [releases page][link_releases]. For example, let's install it on **amd64** arch (e.g.: Debian, Ubuntu, etc):

```shell
$ curl -SsL -o ./poke https://github.com/tarampampam/poke/releases/latest/download/poke-linux-amd64
$ chmod +x ./poke

# optionally, install the binary file globally:
$ sudo install -g root -o root -t /usr/local/bin -v ./poke
$ rm ./poke
$ poke --help
```
Additionally, you can use the docker image:

| Registry                               | Image                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [GitHub Container Registry][link_ghcr] | `ghcr.io/tarampampam/poke` |
| [Docker Hub][link_docker_hub]          | `tarampampam/poke`         |

> Using the `latest` tag for the docker image is highly discouraged because of possible backward-incompatible changes
> during **major** upgrades. Please, use tags in `X.Y.Z` format

## ðŸ”Œ Language reference ([d.ts](internal/js/global.d.ts))

For the more details take a look the [language reference](docs/language.md) and [examples](examples).

## ðŸ—’ TODO

- [ ] `require(<js-or-json-file>)`
- [ ] `Language reference generation`
