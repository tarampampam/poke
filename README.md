  Just imagine, that you can write E2E tests using familiar javascript syntax without any external dependencies,
  like node.js, jest, Axios, etc. Sounds like something impossible? ðŸ˜‰

> ðŸš§ The project currently is under active development. Do not use it somewhere except the testing purposes.

## ðŸ”¥ Features list

- Write your tests in familiar ECMAScript 5.1 syntax - `let`, `const`, arrow functions and classes are supported ([JS VM](https://github.com/dop251/goja) embedded in the app)
- Tests are **parallelized** by running them in their own thread to minimize execution time
- Ready to work out of the box - you won't need to configure anything
- Like any Go application, you can run Poke on Linux, windows, or macOS. Additionally, it ready to integrate with **CI/CD** and **Docker**
- The jest-like syntax (`describe`, `test`, `beforeEach`) for grouping tests cases and asserts
- You can use **fake data generator** (strings, numbers, IP addresses, UUIDs, and so on), **hashing**, and **encoding** functions - they are embedded in the app
- Easy to use by developers and QA engineers
